flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - aniket-deole-M6XC789HLe8-unsplash.jpg
    - tomasz-smal-_HJNQCoXVkU-unsplash.png
    - v2osk-1Z2niiBPg5A-unsplash.png

        # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  fonts:
   - family: Comforter-Regular
     fonts:
       - asset: fonts/Comforter-Regular.ttf
